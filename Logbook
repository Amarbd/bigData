Coach meeting - Mo 18/09/2017
We have made some practical agreements:
coach meetings will be biweekly (starting week 5)
individual coach meetings will be biweekly (starting week 6)
It would be easy to find a certain timeslot in which everyone is always available, but this is not necessary.

We have also decided on the following planning; first month will be about estimating our level of knowledge and evaluate our competences for a new challenge. We start with reading the Titanic tutorial on Kaggle and trying to solve the challenge together.

Meeting 27/09/2017 - Planning for next week
Continue on the Python tutorials
Research on Python IDEâ€™s and decide which we use (collectively)

Meeting 04/10/2017 - with coach
