Coach meeting - Mo 18/09/2017
We have made some practical agreements:
coach meetings will be biweekly (starting week 5)
individual coach meetings will be biweekly (starting week 6)
It would be easy to find a certain timeslot in which everyone is always available, but this is not necessary.

We have also decided on the following planning; first month will be about estimating our level of knowledge and evaluate our competences for a new challenge. We start with reading the Titanic tutorial on Kaggle and trying to solve the challenge together.

Meeting 27/09/2017 - Planning for next week
Continue on the Python tutorials
Research on Python IDEâ€™s and decide which we use (collectively)

Meeting 14/11/2017 - with coach + Erik Bogers
We have decided on doing the music recommender system Kaggle challenge. Veronika will finish the project brief and the 
others will review it. For this, all of us need to write down our personal goals in the document ("Bart's feedback"). 
The goals for next week are:
- taking a look at possible ways to solve the challenge
- Koen + Amar: do some research in project planningn and make a first draft for a project plan
